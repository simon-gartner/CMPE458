DOCUMENTATION

Modifications made:
Instead of hardcoding the test cases as strings, the design of the analyzer was made so that a .txt file can be passed in.
This is to make it easier to design robust test cases that cover all of the needs of our program.

List of changes made:
Added handling for deletion of single-line comments and multi-line comments.
Added handling of keywords and identifiers.
Added handling of string literals.
Added handling of additional operators inluding comparison operators (ex. >,<,>=) and aditional aritmetic operators (++, *, /).
Added handling of delimeters.
Added handling of grammatical elements.

New tokens, grammar rules, or semantic operations added:
Added the followoiing token types: 
    TOKEN_KEYWORD,
    TOKEN_IDENTIFIER,
    TOKEN_COMMENT,
    TOKEN_STRING,
    TOKEN_DELIMITER,
    TOKEN_GRAMMAR

New error signals or handling mechanisms:
The new errors added are ERROR_TOO_LONG, which occurs when a string is made that is over 247 characters long.

TESTING:

How to test:
1. Run: make
2. Run: ./build/compiler input.txt
3. Run: ./build/compiler incorrect_input.txt

These two test cases cover outputs without erros, and outputs with errors.
It is designed to test each new feature added to the lexer and parse the file properly.

The expected output for the test without errors is:

The expected ouput for the test with errors is:
